      <h2>Tokyo History</h2>
      <p>
        Tokyo, formerly known as Edo, is Japan’s capital. In the past, it was a
        small fishing village. Edo became a city during the Tokugawa period. The
        ancient imperial capital was Kyoto, but in 1868 during the Meiji
        Restoration, the capital was moved to Edo. The capital was then renamed
        to Tokyo, which means “eastern capital.” Since the 17th century, Tokyo
        has been Japan’s largest city. It is Japan’s economic, political, and
        cultural centre.
